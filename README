## Tensorflow Playground ##

----------

###Summary

I started this project as a simple sandbox to experiment and apply Machine Learning concepts with bare-metal TensorFlow. 
Over time, I plan to implement more examples and techniques to explore various topics in ML.

Please feel free to use them and point out any improvement/error you may find.

###Results


Currently the following examples are implemented:
 
***MNIST*** 
[Yann LeCun MNIST homepage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
[Tensorflow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)

| Method      | Accuracy | Executable       |
| ------      | -------- | ----------       |
| Linear      | ~ 92     | mnist_logit.py   |
| Neural Net  | ~ 98.5   | mnist_nn.py      |
| CNN LeNet-5 | ~ 99.2   | mnist_convnet.py |	


----------

###Usage

Just run 

    python <executable>

where ***executable*** is one of the provided files in the table of the Results section.
Each executable will try to automatically use all GPUs, or fallback to the cpus if no gpu is available.

At the end of the run, the filters/neurons are plotted on screen for debug purposes.
 
All results were tested under Arch Linux

----------

###Hyperparameters

If you want to tweak the dataset split, networks structure and hyperparameters, you can find them at the beginning of each executable in each section marked with a comment ending like  `==> USER`
The code should be already self-explanatory.
